# devture_systemd_service_manager_service_restart_mode specifies how services are restarted.
#
# Supported values:
# - `clean-stop-start` - services are stopped cleanly (higher priority level stopped earlier) and then started (lower priority level started earlier)
# - `one-by-one` - services are restarted one by one (lower priority level earlier)
#
# The `one-by-one` mode may decrease downtime, but is potentially less reliable and "clean".
systemd_restart_mode: clean-stop-start

# systemd_autostart_enabled controls whether systemd services should auto-start when the system reboots
systemd_autostart_enabled: true

# systemd_verify_up_enabled controls whether this role will verify if the services did manage to start successfully
systemd_verify_up_enabled: true

# systemd_verify_delay specifies how long to wait between starting systemd services and checking if they're started.
#
# A too low value may lead to a failure, as services may not have enough time to start and potentially fail.
#
# A value higher than 30 seconds (or any multiple of that) may also not work well, because a failing systemd service
# auto-restarts after 30 seconds (`RestartSec=30` in systemd service files).
# Checking if a service is running right after it had potentially restarted in such a way will lead us to
# thinking it's running, while it's merely starting again (and likely to fail again, given that it already did once).
#
# All of the services we manage are also started sequentially, which in itself can take a long time.
# There may be a ~10 second (or even larger) interval between starting the first service and starting the last one.
# This makes it even harder to pick a correct value. Such a 10 second gap and a waiting time of 20 seconds will
# put us right at the "dangerous" 30-second mark.
#
# We can try to measure this gap and adjust our waiting time accordingly, but we currently don't.
